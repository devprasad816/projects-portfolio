## Department-wise Attrition Analysis

The Sales department shows the highest attrition, contributing to more than half of the total employee exits. Research and Development experiences moderate attrition levels, while the Human Resources department has the lowest attrition, indicating stronger employee retention.

## Age Group Analysis

The majority of employees belong to the 25 to 34 age group. This group also records the highest attrition, suggesting higher job mobility among early-career professionals. Attrition decreases as age increases, and employees above 45 years demonstrate relatively stable retention.

## Gender-wise Attrition Analysis

Male employees account for a higher portion of attrition compared to female employees. This pattern is consistent across most age groups, particularly between 25 and 44 years.
